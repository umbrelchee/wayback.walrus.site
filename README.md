## Overview

The Decentralized Wayback Machine is a revolutionary archival tool designed to capture, store, and retrieve snapshots of websites across the internet. Unlike traditional web archives, this project leverages Walrus technology on the Sui blockchain to provide a secure, permanent, and fully decentralized solution for preserving the web’s history.

### Why Decentralization Matters

Traditional web archives rely on centralized servers that are vulnerable to censorship, data loss, and manipulation. With our Decentralized Wayback Machine, every snapshot is stored across a network of nodes using Walrus, ensuring:

- Data Integrity: Content is stored in a tamper-proof and immutable manner.
- Permanent Storage: Once archived, a snapshot cannot be altered or deleted, preserving the authenticity of web content.
- Global Accessibility: Archives are stored on the blockchain, making them accessible from anywhere in the world without reliance on a single server.

### How It Works

1. Capture Web Snapshots: Users can capture a snapshot of any public webpage using our simple interface or browser extension.
2. Store with Walrus: Each snapshot is stored using Walrus on the Sui blockchain. Walrus provides content-addressed storage, meaning each file is saved based on its unique cryptographic hash, ensuring data integrity and security.
3. Retrieve Archives: Users can search and retrieve any archived snapshot instantly. Thanks to Walrus’s decentralized nature, retrieval is fast and reliable, free from single points of failure.

### Key Features

- Decentralized Archival: No reliance on centralized servers, ensuring resilience against censorship and data loss.
- Immutable Records: Every snapshot is permanent and cannot be altered, guaranteeing historical accuracy.
- Scalable Storage: By using Walrus, we combine on-chain data integrity with off-chain storage efficiency, allowing for scalable and cost-effective archiving.
- Community-Driven: Users can contribute to the archive by capturing snapshots of important web pages, building a comprehensive and communal web history.

**Walrus is a decentralized storage solution tailored for the Sui blockchain. It enhances the archival process by providing**:

- Scalability: Off-chain storage scalability combined with on-chain data verification ensures efficient and cost-effective archiving.
- Security: Data is stored securely across multiple nodes, reducing the risk of loss or tampering.
- Decentralized Access: Archives are accessible globally without any centralized authority, promoting transparency and freedom of information.
